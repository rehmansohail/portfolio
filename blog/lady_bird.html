        <p>Thank god i watched this movie today. I feel like i could relate a lot more to it at the 
            current point in life. I could see a lot of my younger self in lady bird. She wants to be
            hangout with the popular kids and lies to herself to be like them. But later she reconnects with herself
            and stops pretending to be someone she is not. Her relationship with her best friend changes because of that.
            I think we all go through that phase and once we grow up,
            we realise how stupid it actually was. I love the dynamic she has with her family especially her mom.
            She has that love hate relationship with her mom which is really beautiful to see. While watching it i kinda felt like i was back in my late teens.
            It's incredible how a movie can resonate with us at different stages of life.
            Thanks to all those people who made this work of art possible. This movie really holds a special place 
            in my heart. It's like a nostalgic trip back to our late teens, reminding us of the struggles and joys of that time.
